The project is made above is to classify wether the given image of a lung is a normal lung, Lung affected by covid 19,If it is Viral pneumonia OR BACTERAL pneumonia. To build the baove model we use the transfer learning and the model that we have used to build the CNN network is the ResNET50 Model. After building the CNN network and testing it on the test set we found that accuracy on the test set is 83.33%. We also implemented early stopping in the code to make sure that the model to avoid overfitting. The model can classify the elemnets in a pretty good way.
